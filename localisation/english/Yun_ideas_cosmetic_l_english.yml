 gu_tu_shou_fu_desc:0 "During the crisis of the third century, Roman society was in turmoil, with powerful ministers dividing the territory and the northern barbarians looking at it. When the country's survival was in critical condition, Aurelian, who was a soldier, became Augustus. In just three years, he led the Roman army and people to wipe out the separatist forces in Palmyra and Gaul, and was hailed as the "Restorer of the World." It became a legend for later generations. \nNow, we will also embark on the road to regain our homeland. May the spirit of Aurelian protect us through the darkness until dawn."
