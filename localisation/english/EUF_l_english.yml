austria.1000.t:0 "Towards the Euroepean Federation?"
austria.1000.d:0 "With the Empire successfully federalized, squabblings between Budapest and Vienna that used to dominate political scenes begin to subside as people increasingly recognize themselves as citizens of the Danubian Federation instead of any nation-states. As such, foreign policies have become a hot-debated issue as we resolved internal conflicts and look forward to projecting our power abroad. The Kalergite DBP has long been dreaming of fulfilling the ideal of von Coudenhove-Kalergi, the founder of their party, and uniting continental Europe under a single political entity, though Britain and Russia are not included in this grand scheme, as Kalergi believes Britain has her own cultural sphere, and Russia is the leader of Eurasia civilization. They argue that Danubia is a perfect vehicle to achieve Paneuropeanism since we have already demonstrated that building a stable multicultural and multiethic federation is feasible. Plus, to better safeguard the continental federation, colonies of France, Germany, Netherlands, and Portugal will also be incorporated into the new state. However, in doing so, we will face the risk of angering countries that wish to keep their sovereignty. And syndicalist radicals would not even consider our proposal as they seek nothing but the total destruction of Habsburg monarchy. The question is, should we give the green light to Kalergi and his DBP to pursue their Paneuropean project, or we should just not shake up the already-delicate geopolitical situations?"
austria.1000.a:0 "A federated Europe should be our goal!"
austria.1000.b:0 "We are fine with Daunbia."

austria.1001.t:0 "Name for the European Federation"
austria.1001.d:0 "We should set on a name for our new state to represent our Paneuropean values and cultures."
austria.1001.a:0 "European Federal Union."
austria.1001.b:0 "United States of Europe."

austria.1002.t:0 "Pick a Flag"
austria.1002.d:0 "Pick a flag for our Paneuropean Union."
austria.1002.a:0 "European Federal Union flag."
austria.1002.b:0 "United States of Europe flag."

austria.1003.t:0 "Shifting Tides"
austria.1003.d:0 "After Paneuropeanism becomes our national policy, the political landscape shifted to accommodate this change. Political parties of Austria absorb local organizations with similar ideologies from our former constituents and reorganize into new federal-level parties. Europäische Partei der Sozialdemokraten represents the social demoracts and upholds Austromarxism. Europäische Bundespartei is a direct evolution of DBP, which was the main proponent of Paneuropeanism. Allianz europäischer Christen and Partei für europäischen Frieden und Freiheit are the bastion of right-wing conservatives, they are highly scepetical of Paneuropeanism, though they do not openly oppose the concept. Currently, these parties are still dominated by Austrian politicians, but someday, they will provide avenues for all Europeans to represent themselves."
austria.1003.a:0 "Very well."

austria.1004.t:0 "The First Paneuropean Election"
austria.1004.d:0 "With most parts of Europe united under our flag, Paneuropean ideas spread, and federal parties expanded into these newly incorporated territories. As such, people called for holding a new election to reflect this change. As the vote counting finished, the result is finally in. Which party wins the election at the end of the day?"
austria.1004.a:0 "Europäische Partei der Sozialdemokraten."
austria.1004.b:0 "Europäische Bundespartei."
austria.1004.c:0 "Allianz europäischer Christen."
austria.1004.e:0 "Partei für europäischen Frieden und Freiheit."

austria.1005.t:0 "Afrika Policy"
austria.1005.d:0 "How should we deal with our possessions in Afrika?"
austria.1005.a:0 "Set up a mandate in Algiers."
austria.1005.b:0 "We should directly control these areas."

austria.1006.t:0 "Asia Policy"
austria.1006.d:0 "How should we deal with our possessions in Asia?"
austria.1006.a:0 "Set up a mandate in Malaya."
austria.1006.b:0 "We should directly control these areas."

austria.9999.t:0 "FUMO Coups Our Country"
austria.9999.d:0 "Izayoi Sakuya overthrew our government and established the rule of Touhou faggots."
austria.9999.a:0 "Acknowledged."
